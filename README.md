Title: Housing Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Description:

This repository focuses on cleaning and preprocessing a housing dataset to prepare it for machine learning model training. The goal is to transform raw data into a high-quality format suitable for building robust and accurate predictive models.

Key Points:

Data Exploration and Cleaning: We explore the housing data to identify and address any missing values, inconsistencies, or outliers. Data cleaning techniques like imputation, scaling, and encoding might be employed to ensure the data is well-suited for machine learning algorithms.
Preprocessing Pipeline: The code demonstrates a structured approach to data preprocessing tasks. We aim to create a reusable pipeline that can be easily applied to similar datasets.
Machine Learning Readiness: By the end of the preprocessing steps, the housing data will be ready for feeding into machine learning models for tasks like price prediction, market analysis, or other relevant applications.
